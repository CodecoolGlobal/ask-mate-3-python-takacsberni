# AskMate

In this team project out task was to implement a crowdsourced Q&A site, 
similar to Stack Overflow. We designed it in 3 sprints, in 3 weeks. 
This project is the most lasting for me during Codecool, because there 
was fantastic teamwork behind it, we were all very motivated in 
its preparation and planning and often even worked on it in the evening.
